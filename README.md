3. Design and develop an additional screen for game details.
4. Integrate custom images for thumbnails or other image paths.

## Features

- **Figma Implementation**: Screens are replicated with a focus on pixel perfection, ensuring alignment, spacing, typography, and visual consistency.
- **API Integration**: Data is fetched from mock API endpoints for games and tournaments, handling responses appropriately.
- **Game Details Screen**: A custom-designed screen provides detailed information about selected games.
- **Image Integration**: Custom images are used for game thumbnails or other image paths where API data lacks images.
